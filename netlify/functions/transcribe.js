The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to a Netlify Function (`transcribe.js`) failing to require one of its dependencies (`busboy`) as indicated in [line 102](#L102) of the log.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue:
1. Verify that the `busboy` module is included in the site's top-level "package.json" file.
2. If `busboy` is missing, add it to the dependencies in the "package.json".

After ensuring `busboy` is in the "package.json", redeploy the site to see if the build issue is resolved.
